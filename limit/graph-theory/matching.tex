\paragraph{Tutte-Berge formula}
The theorem states that the size of a maximum matching of a graph $G=(V,E)$ equals

$${\frac {1}{2}}\min _{U\subseteq V}\left(|U|-\operatorname {odd} (G-U)+|V|\right)\,,$$
where $\operatorname {odd} (H)$ counts how many of the connected components of the graph $H$ have an odd number of vertices.

\paragraph{Tutte theorem}

A graph, $G = (V, E)$, has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset $U$ of $V$, the subgraph induced by $V-U$ has at most $|U|$ connected components with an odd number of vertices.

\paragraph{Hall's marriage theorem}

A family $S$ of finite sets has a transversal if and only if $S$ satisfies the marriage condition.
